# Melanin Match AI  

🚧 **Work in Progress** — This project is currently in development as part of my **Graduate Computer Vision course (Fall 2025)**. It will also serve as a **portfolio project** highlighting inclusive AI in beauty tech.  

---

## ✨ Project Vision  
**Melanin Match AI** is a computer vision tool designed to analyze skin tones inclusively across the full spectrum — with special focus on deeper complexions — and recommend foundation/concealer shades that match.  

The goal is to combine **AI fairness + computer vision** to build a beauty tech tool that works for everyone.  

---

## 📌 Planned Features  
- 🖼️ **Skin Detection**: Use OpenCV + HSV color thresholds to detect skin regions.  
- 🎨 **Inclusive Tone Matching**: Classify tones and undertones (warm, neutral, cool) across light → deep complexions.  
- 📦 **Product Mapping**: Match detected tones with foundation/concealer shade catalogs (Fenty, Too Faced, Maybelline, etc.).  
- ⚖️ **Bias & Fairness**: Transparent methods, lighting guidance, and limitations documented to ensure diverse representation.  

---

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **OpenCV / scikit-image** (image preprocessing & detection)  
- **NumPy / scikit-learn** (clustering, classification)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (prototyping & testing)  
- **JSON catalogs** (shade/product databases)  

---

## 🚀 Roadmap  
- [ ] Research & collect open datasets of diverse skin tones  
- [ ] Build baseline pipeline for skin detection + color statistics  
- [ ] Implement clustering & tone bucketing  
- [ ] Add product shade mapping system  
- [ ] Bias evaluation + ethical guidelines  
- [ ] Build demo script + documentation

## ✨ Why This Project Matters  
Many AI-powered beauty tools fail to account for deeper skin tones, leading to poor product recommendations.  
**Melanin Match AI** aims to be one of the first **open-source, inclusive beauty AI projects** designed with diversity and fairness at the center.
